Implementation Summary: Personalized Learning Pathway Generator

1) Authentication & Persistence
- Added signup, login, logout routes using Flask sessions
- Persisted learning profile, generated pathways, and per-resource progress with SQLAlchemy models (User, LearningPathway, Progress)
- Dashboard loads latest user pathway from DB and aggregates per-user progress

2) Dashboard & Progress
- Dashboard shows accurate per-skill progress and overall completion
- Progress updates are upserted in DB and aggregated for logged-in users
- Client-side Progress Overview recomputes counts from DOM for instant updates

3) Resource Aggregation & Quality
- Faster aggregation with tuned limits and optional URL validation via VALIDATE_URLS
- Role-aware search/ranking to prioritize career-relevant resources
- Curated, stable sources seeded (freeCodeCamp, MDN, scikit-learn, MIT OCW, Visualgo, Kaggle, fast.ai)
- Keyword seeds and generic fallbacks ensure every topic has URLs

4) Deduplication & Relevance
- Canonical URL and fuzzy title matching remove duplicates within topics and across modules
- Topic-level positive/negative filters reduce cross-domain bleed
- Stricter role/skills filtering with fallback to ranked results and curated items

5) UI/UX Enhancements
- Achievement modal escapable, cleans up backdrops, auto-closes; loading overlay hidden before modal
- Topics show empty-state when no resources available

6) Git & Branching
- All changes pushed to branch: cursor/add-user-auth-persistent-data-and-push-to-github-2206
- Per request, rollback to 267804f performed, then iterative fixes added
